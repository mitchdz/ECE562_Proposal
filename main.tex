\section{Topic Description}
The goal of this project is to create a flight controller for a drone using a RISC V architecture. This includes purchasing and building a micro drone that will fashion a RISC V FPGA in order to create custom ISA subroutines for the drone. These custom subroutines will range from simple things such as move forward x feet to more complex things such as move to a certain GPS locaiton. The implementation of the more complex subroutines will get completed if time permits.

\section{Motivation}
The team taking on this project simply likes building and making drones. The project seems doable in a semester, but still offers a fun and challenging thing to solve. The goal here is not to make something super novel, but rather to have fun and learn a lot about RISC V ISA in the process.
